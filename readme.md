## 1. Running the Application Locally

To run the application in your local environment, you need to start the Flask server using the following command:

> `python app.py`

---

## 2. Building and Testing the Docker Image

Once you have a Dockerfile, you can build an image and then test it:

**Step 2.1: Building the Docker Image**

> `docker build -t my_flask_app .`

**Step 2.2: Running the Docker Container**

> `docker run -p 8080:8080 my_flask_app`

---

## 3. Deployment Steps

To deploy the Docker image to Google Cloud Run, follow these steps:

**Step 3.1: Configuring Docker with GCloud**

> `gcloud auth configure-docker`

**Step 3.2: Tagging the Docker Image**

Replace `[YOUR-PROJECT-ID]` with your Google Cloud project ID.

> `docker tag my_flask_app gcr.io/[YOUR-PROJECT-ID]/my_flask_app`

**Step 3.3: Pushing the Docker Image**

> `docker push gcr.io/[YOUR-PROJECT-ID]/my_flask_app`

**Step 3.4: Deploying to Google Cloud Run**

Replace `SERVICE_NAME`, `PROJECT_ID`, `IMAGE_NAME`, and `REGION_NAME` with your service name, project ID, image name, and region respectively. For example:

> `gcloud run deploy flask-app --image gcr.io/flask-app-2023-387823/my_flask_app --platform managed --region us-central1`

---

## 4. Implementing CI/CD

You can automate the build and deployment process with Google Cloud Build.

**Step 4.1: Creating a Build Trigger**

Create a build trigger as per the instructions provided [here](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/create-manage-triggers).

**Step 4.2: Adding a cloudbuild.yaml File**

Add a `cloudbuild.yaml` file to your GitHub repository, which specifies the build steps. This file automates the following:

- Building a Docker image from your Dockerfile.
- Pushing the Docker image to the Google Container Registry.
- Deploying the Docker image to Google Cloud Run.

Replace `my-service` with your actual service name and `us-central1` with your desired region. The `$PROJECT_ID` will be automatically replaced by your GCP project ID.
